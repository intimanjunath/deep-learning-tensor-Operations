# Tensor Operations Practice with TensorFlow 2.0 & PyTorch

This repository contains a comprehensive assignment designed for master's-level students to practice fundamental tensor operations in modern machine learning frameworks. The notebooks demonstrate a variety of tensor manipulations using both TensorFlow 2.0 and PyTorch, including advanced operations like einsum, reshaping, slicing, concatenating, and gradient computation.

## Repository Overview

- **TensorFlow Operations:**  
  Explore basic and advanced tensor operations including creation, arithmetic, broadcasting, matrix multiplication, einsum operations, and gradient computations using TensorFlow 2.0.

  Code:https://github.com/intimanjunath/deep-learning-tensor-Operations/blob/main/TensorFlow_2_0_Operations.ipynb
  
- **PyTorch Operations:**  
  Learn similar tensor operations using PyTorch. This section also utilizes [einops](https://github.com/arogozhnikov/einops) for additional tensor manipulation capabilities.

  Code:https://github.com/intimanjunath/deep-learning-tensor-Operations/blob/main/PyTorch_Operations.ipynb

- **Visualization:**  
  Both notebooks include visualizations using Matplotlib to help illustrate matrix operations, broadcasting, and other tensor transformations.

## Features

- **Tensor Creation & Properties:**  
  Create scalars, vectors, matrices, and multi-dimensional tensors, and inspect their properties (shape, data type, dimensions).

- **Type Casting & Arithmetic:**  
  Perform type casting and basic arithmetic operations on tensors.

- **Einsum Operations:**  
  Demonstrate the power of Einstein summation for tasks such as matrix multiplication, element-wise multiplication, and outer products.

- **Advanced Tensor Manipulations:**  
  Reshape, slice, concatenate, and stack tensors along different dimensions.

- **Gradient Computation:**  
  Compute gradients using TensorFlow’s `GradientTape` and PyTorch’s autograd mechanism.

- **Visualization:**  
  Utilize Matplotlib to visualize random tensors, matrix multiplications, and broadcasting examples.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.6+**
- **TensorFlow 2.x**
- **PyTorch** (with `einops`)
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**

You can install the necessary packages using:

```bash
pip install tensorflow torch numpy matplotlib einops
```

## How to Use
Both notebooks are fully compatible with Google Colab:

- Open `TensorFlow_Operations.ipynb` in Colab.
- Open `PyTorch_Operations.ipynb` in Colab.
- Run all cells to see the demonstrations and visualizations.

### YouTube Video Tutorial
I have created a detailed YouTube video that explains the tensor operations, walks through the code, and shows how to run the notebooks. Watch the video below:
